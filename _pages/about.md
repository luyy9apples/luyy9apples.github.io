I'm Yuyin Lu, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Prof. Rao.

My early work focused on embedding learning for NLP applications. Currently, I specialize in **Knowledge Graph Reasoning** and **Neuro-Symbolic AI**, with deep interest in exploring AI's logical reasoning capabilities and cognitive mechanisms.
