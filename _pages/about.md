I'm Yuyin Lu, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, under the supervision of Prof. Rao.

My research focuses on Knowledge Graph Reasoning and Neuro-Symbolic AI, driven by a deep interest in advancing AI's logical reasoning capabilities and cognitive mechanisms.

Philosophically inspired by symbolic logic and semiotics, my work aims to reconceptualize these principles computationally to develop interpretable AI systems â€“ a core objective guiding my research trajectory.
